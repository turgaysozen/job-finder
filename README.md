<h2>I built this project for me to find a job what I want. Currently is has small problem with Redis and Heroku so it is not public to use, so I might migrate it to the MongoDB. It works perfect on localhost, it has Cron job and runs every 3 hours, fetch thousands of jobs from the github and stackoverflow. After a short time it will scrape jobs from other platforms. It filters non-english jobs, also it provides over 2000 jobs by API.
You can clone it and use it on your project..<h2>
